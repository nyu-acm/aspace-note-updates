# aspace-note-updates
This script modifies or deletes a specific note type in ArchivesSpace based on information supplied by the user. The user can select whether their input must simply be contained in the original note text, or if it must exactly match the original note content. String matches to user input are case sensitive.

The script will produce a log file of all of the changes made.

This script is adapted from the advancedNoteEdit.py script created by the Rockefeller Archives Center. We borrow their original code with much gratitude.
